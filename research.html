    <h1 class="title">Alexa Voice Scramble Research</h1>

    <p class="about">
      This page details the research that led to Alexa Voice Scramble's final
      implementation. Here, you will find video and audio recordings of my interactions
      with Alexa that provide information on how the Alexa functions, listens, and learns.
      You will also find my analysis of my interactions with Alexa and how these analyses led to
      specfic design decisions within the Alexa Voice Scramble algorithm. <br>
       <br>
      I share this information with hopes that others will use my research as a
      springboard for finding their own unique and creative ways for subverting
      and reclaiming Amazon's Alexa Voice Services audio surveillance
      algorithms.

    <h1 class="title">Process Documentation</h1>

    <p class="list">
      My initial idea for Alexa Voice Scramble was to play back scrambled vocal recordings to an Alexa. Having some peripheral experience using an Alexa, I knew that I would have to incorporate a “Wake Word” into my system. A wake word is what the Alexa listens for 24/7 in order to begin a query to its servers to listen to the user’s request to generate a response. By default, the wake word is Alexa, so I stuck with that.

    <h2 class="title">Attempt 1: Engage Word Failure</h2>
    <p class="list">
       In the first test with the system, the user would record their question always preceded by a wake word. My Alexa Voice Scramble algorithm would then slice their recording into each individual words and store each word into a separate audio file. This way, the algorithm could retrieve and playback the wake word “Alexa” to the system. The rest of the words in the question would be played back in a random order.
