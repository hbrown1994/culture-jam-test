    <h1 class="title">Alexa Voice Scramble Research</h1>

    <p class="about">
      This page details the research that led to Alexa Voice Scramble's final
      implementation. Here, you will find video and audio recordings of my interactions
      with Alexa that provide information on how the Alexa functions, listens, and learns.
      You will also find my analysis of my interactions with Alexa and how these analyses led to
      specfic design decisions within the Alexa Voice Scramble algorithm. <br>
       <br>
      I share this information with hopes that others will use my research as a
      springboard for finding their own unique and creative ways for subverting
      and reclaiming Amazon's Alexa Voice Services audio surveillance
      algorithms.

    <h1 class="title">Process Documentation</h1>
    <h2 class="title">1: Skill Word Failures</h2>

    <p class="list">
      My initial idea for Alexa Voice Scramble was to record a user's query to
      the Alexa, and scramble the order of the words in their individual recording before
      playing it back to the Alexa without the Alexa hearing the orginal query.
      Having some peripheral experience using an Alexa,
      I knew that I would have to incorporate a “Wake Word” into my system.
      A wake word is what the Alexa listens for 24/7 in order to begin a query
      to its servers to listen to the user’s request to generate a response.
      By default, the wake word is Alexa, so I stuck with that.
    </p>

    <p class="list">
       In the first test with the system, the user would record their question
       always preceded by a wake word. My Alexa Voice Scramble algorithm would
       then slice their recording into each individual words and store each word
       into a separate audio file. This way, the algorithm could retrieve and
       playback the wake word “Alexa” to the system. The rest of the words in
       the question would be played back in a random order. Here is an example:

    <p class="list">
      As seen in the above video, the Alexa did not engage with the scrambled audio.
      This is because the Alexa did not clearly hear a "Skill Word."
      A "skill word" such as "How," "Why," "Play," "Find," "Google," "Where," etc
      directs the Alexa to access one oof its predetermined skills. The word "play"
      was heard for a moment, but it was cut short and the Alexa did not engage.
      In my trials, the Alexa needs to hear one of these words in order to generate a response.
      To fix this, I made sure to playback the first two words spoken by the user
      before scrambling the audio, the wake word followed by the "skill word."
    </p>

    <h2 class="title">2: Playback Length and Wake Word Retrigger Issues</h2>

    <p class="list">
      Another error I found in trying to generate a response with scrambled audio
      was when the audio sample lasted too long. I found that shorter queries
      work best. Below is an example that contains a clear skill word and a
      query that is too long. This example also has the error of retriggering the "wake word"
      by playing back the recorded word "Alexa." This always resulted in a lack of response
      from the device.

    <p class="list">
      I fixed this error of exluding the word "Alexa" and the skill word from the
      bank of samples avaliable to the algorithm's "scrambling function." Here is
      an example with these issues solved, finally resulting in a decent reply
      from the Alexa!

    <h2 class="title">3: Long Term Considerations</h2>

    <p class="list">
      After getting the Alexa to actually generate a response to the scrambled
      audio, I thought it would be interesting to use more than just the present
      user's query as the material for the scrambled audio. I thought this
      was a good way to further confuse the Alexa into generating responses that
      were far off from the orginal query. I also hoped this larger range of
      possible scrambled output would contaminate the Alexa Voice Services'
      training data even more.
     <br>
     <br>
      To do this, I began saving the individual recordings of every word from each entry
      to the bank of audio that the "scrambler" could access in genertaing its response.
      I also set the algorithm to scan through through the scrambled audio faster sometimes,
      so that some words wouldn't play all the way through, acting as single syllables.
      This technique generated much more diverse and unrealted responses than before.
      See an example below:
    </p>

    <h2 class="title">4: Alexa's Output & Visual Presentaion</h2>
    <p class="list">
      After feeding the Alexa audio data in the way I thought would be most effective
      and being able to generate intersting response from the Alexa, I wanted to
      consider how the Alexa Voice Scramble would interact with the user.
      <br>
      <br>
      I wanted to develop this idea of broken communication that is captured
      by the scrambled vocal recordings and the bizzare responses from the Alexa.
      Amazon wants the users of their devices to feel as though they are clearly
      communiating with the Alexa, that the Alexa is serving their needs and requests
      as accuratly as possible. But there is a hidden communication breakdown here.
      Amazon's interest in the clairty of communication is motivated by a desire to garner
      capital from their user's voice data. The user thinks they have
      paid for this service with the money they paid for the device, but
      they are really paying with their personal data.
      Their data is the real price they are paying for this device, without
      knowing it or consenting to it.
      <br>
      <br>
      By totally breaking down the line of communication between the Alexa and
      the user, I am also breaking down an hidden exchange of capital.
      With Alexa Voice Scramble, there is nothing of value
      being exchanged, just a signal containing mangled, disformed, and unintelligible audio.
      Amazon isn't getting their clean and usable data, and the user isn't
      getting the product they didn't know they're always paying for.
      <br>
      <br>
      To implement this idea into sound, I developed a digital audio processing
      unit that is modelled to sound like exaggerated drops in internet connectivity.
      These are the sounds we're all familiar with by now, as I'm sure we've heard the
      glitched out, robotic, and brittle manipulations of our peers and professors voices
      over Zoom, Jitsi, or Google Meet. This sounds like the Alexa is struggling
      to get the information from its servers back to you, that its line of
      communication to its servers are infected by some kind of digital
      corrsion.
      <br>
      <br>
      Visually, I decided to stream the screen from the Alexa to Alexa Voice
      Scramble interactive portal. When the Alexa responds, it displays some
      truncated form of the information on the screen, like an image from Google
      or a bit of speech-to-text translation. I wanted these visuals to be
      presented unaffected alongside the mangled audio response. This creates
      a dissonance where the user gets a small piece of the thing they requested,
      but the audio that includes all of the information does not clearly
      communicate it. These juxtapostions result in some interesting
      pairings audio visual pairings.
      <br>
      <br>
      This treatment of Alexa Voice Scramble's output was the last step in
      my process. Below is a video showing an interaction with Alexa Voice
      Scramble in its final form.
