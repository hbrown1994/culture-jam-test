    <h1 class="title">Alexa Voice Scramble Research</h1>

    <p class="about">
      This page details the research that led to Alexa Voice Scramble's final
      implementation. Here, you will find video and audio recordings of my interactions
      with Alexa that provide information on how the Alexa functions, listens, and learns.
      You will also find my analysis of my interactions with Alexa and how these analyses led to
      specfic design decisions within the Alexa Voice Scramble algorithm. <br>
       <br>
      I share this information with hopes that others will use my research as a
      springboard for finding their own unique and creative ways for subverting
      and reclaiming Amazon's Alexa Voice Services audio surveillance
      algorithms.
