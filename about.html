    <h1 class="title">About Alexa Voice Scramble (AVS)</h1>

    <p class="intro">
      The Amazon Echo Show is one of Amazon’s “smart devices” in which a user can
      speak to the device and access its various “skills.” The skills these devices’
      can complete are comprehensive, including commands such as “Play the new
      Rihanna album,” “Find a good cookie recipe,” or “Add grocery shopping to my to-do list.”
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
      To do this, the device records the user’s voice via a built-in microphone
       before sending these recordings to Amazon’s cloud based audio processing
       algorithm, Alexa Voice Services (Alexa). While Amazon states that you are
       able to delete the recording made by your device, it is unclear about what
       they do with the data from those recordings. If you can’t trust Facebook
       and Google to not take and use your data despite your clear lack of
       consent,  <a class="links" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow_profile">can you trust Amazon?</a>
       Alexa uses machine learning to analyze these recordings so the smart device
       can accurately complete these tasks. <a class="links" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/bernardmarr/2018/10/05/how-does-amazons-alexa-really-work/?sh=3ded652b1937">Alexa gets more accurate as it
       receives more popularity and as the amount of data it gathers increases.</a>
       Every time Alexa misunderstands your command, that data is used to
       improve the system’s performance the next time around.
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
      Alexa Voice Services also extracts data from these recordings in order to better interface with their users. For instance, Alexa Voice Services extracts audio data to better understand the user’s voice so that the user’s commands are more easily understood. Alexa Voice Services also uses data from these audio recordings to measure the acoustics in your room, so they can apply echo cancellation and ambient noise reduction algorithms to more accurately extract data from one’s voice.
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
      This may seem like processes meant to make the user’s life more convenient, but they are also insidious methods of extracting capital via audio surveillance. Once Alexa Voice Services begins to construct a machine learning model of someone’s voice, they are able to better transcribe the emotional and conversational nuances of a person’s voice in order to bombard that person with <a class="links" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/xwjden/targeted-advertising-is-ruining-the-internet-and-breaking-the-world">targeted ads</a> Alexa Voice Services is also able to learn the acoustics of your home. How big each room is, how many rooms you have, what appliances and objects you have in your home, where someone might be located within a home at a given moment… you get the picture.
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
      Alexa Voice Scramble (AVS) is part software program and part sound art installation designed to subvert, bring critical attention to, and promote the contamination of the data driving Amazon’s cloud-based voice recognition and natural language processing software Alexa Voice Services.
    </p>

    <p class="intro">
      Users of Alexa Voice Scramble will interact with the same physical Amazon Echo Show device over live streamed audio projected in to the same room as the physical device. The Alexa’s built-in Audio Signal Processing unit uses Acoustic Echo Cancellation (AEC), noise suppression, beam forming, Voice Activity Detection (VAD), Dynamic Range Compression (DRC), and equalization to “clean up” the recordings of the user’s voice so that it can enter extract information from these recordings. Alexa Voice Scramble will transform the user’s vocal inputs in ways to make these “cleaning up” processes impossible for the Alexa, therefore contaminating the dataset this physical Alexa device is sending to it’s machine learning training database. With enough users feeding contaminated data to Amazon’s voice training data, Amazon’s ability to track its users will be diminished.
